## Notes

 - **Figma:** I had no access to the dev version of the Figma design, so some paddings, margins, and other measures might not be accurate. If there is a need for this be exact, I need a different permission to the file.
- **GitHub Pages:** It is running on [GitHub Pages](https://adrianvide.github.io/seat/) but for some reason there are couple of issues with the CSS there. I hadn't tested it on a real server, but works fine locally.
