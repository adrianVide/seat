# README

## Description

This repository contains an HTML document along with associated CSS and JavaScript files. The HTML document represents a webpage for a banking application designed for freelancers. It includes sections for the header, hero, card details, financial insights, support, pricing plans, FAQs, and footer.

## Usage

To use this webpage, simply open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser. The associated CSS file (`styles.css`) provides styling for the webpage, while the JavaScript file (`app.js`) adds interactivity and dynamic functionality.

It is running on [GitHub Pages](https://adrianvide.github.io/seat/) too but for some reason there are couple of issues with the CSS there. I hadn't tested it on a real server, but works fine locally.
